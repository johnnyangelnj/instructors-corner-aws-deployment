		<h3><a name="faq1"></a>How long will it take to download the course presentation?</h3>
		<p>Because the course presentation includes the required video segments from the Administering Emergency Oxygen course, it may take a while to download on certain types of equipment. Please allow 10 minutes or more to successfully download the files onto your computer. We recommend you download the application and practice delivering a course a few times so you familiar with the technology before using it in class. Be sure to have a printed copy of the lesson plan (Administering Emergency Oxygen Instructor’s Manual, Section 2) to guide you through the course. It is also recommended that you have a backup copy of the DVD in case technical difficulties occur.</p><br/>
		 

		<h3><a name="faq2"></a>What is a "zipped" file?</h3>
		<p>A "zipped" file is nothing more than a compressed version of a file and at a smaller size.</p><br/>

		<!-- 
		<h3><a name="faq3"></a>What if I have problems downloading the "zipped" file?</h3>
		<p></p><br/>
		 -->

		<h3><a name="faq4"></a>Are the embedded video segments the same ones as on the DVD?</h3>
		<p>The video segments in the course presentation are the same ones on the DVD. In developing the course presentation for classroom use, every effort has been made to ensure that the embedded video delivers optimal results across a variety of system configurations. Video playback on the course presentation, although excellent, differs from the results you can achieve with a DVD. If you are unhappy with the results of the course presentation using your hardware and projection equipment, we recommend using the DVD to present the video portion of your training program.</p> <br/>
 
		<h3><a name="faq5"></a>I get a blank screen in the web browser when I try to open the downloaded PDF.</h3>
		<p>This can happen because:</p>

			<div class="list">
				<ul>
					<li>Acrobat or Reader can't read the PDF file.</li>
					<li>The web browser isn't configured correctly with the Adobe PDF Browser plug-in.</li>
					<li>The web server on which the PDF file is stored can't serve the PDF file.</li>
					<li>You are using a 64-bit version of the Internet Explorer browser.</li>
				</ul>
			</div> 

		<p>Try the following solutions in order.</p> 

		<p><strong>1. Restart your computer and try opening the PDF again.</strong></p>
		<p>Sometimes restarting can resolve common issues.</p><br/>

		<p><strong>2. Open a local copy of a PDF in the web browser.</strong></p>
		<p>Determine if your web browser can open the PDF from your local hard drive rather than from the web:</p>
			<div class="list">
				<ul>
					<li>In your web browser, choose File > Open (or Open File).</li>
					<li>Choose All Files from the Files Of Type pop-up menu (Windows).</li>
					<li>Click Browse.</li>
					<li>Select a PDF file you have saved previously, and then click Open to open the PDF file. If Acrobat or Adobe Reader displays the file but doesn't display it on the web, the web server has a problem serving the PDF file. Contact the webmaster of the site from which you downloaded the PDF file.</li>
				</ul>
			</div><br/>

		<p><strong>3. Download the PDF again.</strong></p>
		<p>Try to download the PDF again from the Instructor’s Corner location.</p><br/>

		<p><strong>4. Delete temporary Internet files (Internet Explorer and Firefox).</strong></p>
		<p>In Internet Explorer, delete the temporary files that Internet Explorer creates:</p>
			<div class="list">
				<ul>
					<li>In Internet Explorer, select Tools > Internet Options.</li>
					<li>Click Delete Files in the General tab, and then click OK when prompted.</li>
				</ul>
			</div>

		<p>In Firefox, delete the temporary files that Firefox creates:</p>
			<div class="list">
				<ul>
					<li>In Firefox, select Tools > Clear Private Data.</li>
					<li>Deselect all options except Cache.</li>
					<li>Click Clear Private Data Now.</li>
				</ul>
			</div><br/> 

		<p><strong>5. Deselect and then reselect the Display PDF In Browser preference.</strong></p>

			<div class="list">
				<ul>
					<li>In Adobe Reader or Acrobat, choose Edit > Preferences.</li>
					<li>Select Internet.</li>
					<li>Deselect Display PDF In Browser, and then click OK.</li>
					<li>Choose Edit > Preferences > Internet, select Display PDF In Browser, and 	then click OK.</li>
				</ul>
			</div><br/>

		<p><strong>6. Install the latest version of Adobe Reader or Acrobat.</strong></p> 
		<p>Always use the latest version of Adobe Reader or Acrobat. Before you install an update or upgrade, make sure that the system meets the requirements. For updates, check the Adobe website at www.adobe.com/support/downloads.</p>

		<p><strong>7. Remove all versions of Acrobat, and then reinstall.</strong></p>
		<p>Adobe doesn't support multiple versions of Adobe Reader or Acrobat on the same computer. Multiple versions simultaneously installed can lead to software conflicts and errors. Only install one version of either Reader or Acrobat. Uninstall all versions of Adobe Reader or Acrobat and then reinstall only one version of either Reader or Acrobat.</p><br/>


		<h3><a name="faq6"></a>I get the following error when I try to open the downloaded PDF: "The Adobe Acrobat/Reader that is running cannot be used to view PDF files in a web browser. Adobe Acrobat/Reader version 8 or 9 is required. Please exit and try again."</h3>
		<p>See the answer to "I get a blank screen in the web browser when I try to open the downloaded PDF" above.</p>


		<h3><a name="faq7"></a>When downloading the presentation, the download quits, or "times out."</h3>
		<p>Check the System Requirements and make sure you have the right hardware and equipment. You should also check how fast your Internet speed and signal are.</p><br/>


		<h3><a name="faq8"></a>After downloading the presentation, the following error messages appear: "There was an error opening the file; another program was using the program." "The file was damaged and could not be repaired."</h3>
		<p>Make sure you have Adobe Reader 9. It can be downloaded for free at <a href="http://get.adobe.com/reader/" target="_blank">http://get.adobe.com/reader/</a>. Before you install an update or upgrade, make sure that the system meets the requirements.</p><br/>
 
		<h3><a name="faq9"></a>After downloading the presentation, I receive a message that the files are quarantined.</h3>
		<p>You may need to disable any virus software you currently have on your system. If there is an Information Technology department you can consult, please check with them first.</p>
